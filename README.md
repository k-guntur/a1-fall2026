# **Learning Objectives:**

-   Create a simple, interactive mobile application using Android, Kotlin,
    and Jetpack Compose.
-   Document an object-oriented design using Unified Modeling Language
    (UML).

# **Problem Description:**
Develop an Android app called **YOURCCID-RapidRecall** (e.g., student1-RapidRecall) that challenges users to remember a sequence of digits. 
Before starting a round, players can choose the length of the number sequence they want to recall. During gameplay, each digit in the sequence is shown briefly, then the user must accurately input the entire sequence in the same order. Feedback is given to the player, and the app records each attempt. The app also displays a summary of the user's attempts during the current session.

1.  Features:
    
    -   **Sequence Length is Selectable:** Users can choose to recall a sequence
        between 1 and 10 digits long. 
    -   **Sequence Display:** When the user starts a game, the app should
        display one digit at a time of a randomly generated sequence based
        on the sequence length chosen.
    -   **User Input and Feedback:** Users can input their guess in an input field,
        and will receive feedback indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect,
        along with a comparison of the correct sequence and their input.
    -   **Logging Functionality:**  Each completed attempt records the sequence length,
        the user's input, the target sequence, whether the attempt was correct, and 
        the current timestamp.
    -   **Gameplay Summary:** Users can view a simple summary, including the
        total number of attempts, the number of correct attempts, and overall
        accuracy percentage across all games. 
    -   **User-Friendly Interface:** The app must provide a simple and
        attractive user interface to enhance ease of use.
    -   **Note:** Your app does not need to have a database with database
        persistence. Session persistence is fine.

2.  Deliverables:

    1.  **Code Base:**
        -   Complete Android Studio project and compiled APK.
        -   Each class must be properly commented to describe its
            purpose, design rationale, and any outstanding issues.
    2.  **Video:**
        -   A demonstration video (max 3 minutes) showing the app\'s
            core functionalities without audio. It should illustrate the
            gameplay and viewing of the logging and summary features.
    3.  **System Documentation:**
        -   UML class diagram(s) detailing the app\'s object-oriented
            design. Include notes on each class\'s main
            responsibilities.
    3.  **License**
        - LICENSE your assignment with an opensource license. Add a
          **LICENSE.md** file to the root directory of the assignment
          that contains an opensource license that will be used for
          the assignment.
          - Apache 2.0 or GPL 3.0 or AGPL 3.0 are recommended

3.  Demonstration Actions:
    1.  Open the app from the launcher.
    2.  Show the start screen with the options start, log, and attempt summary.
    3.  Start a game and select a sequence length *n*.
    5.  Show that the *n* digits of the randomly generated sequence appear one at a time.
    6.  Wait for the sequence to finish.
    7.  Input the sequence correctly in an input field.
    8.  Show user feedback for correct input.
    9.  Return to the start screen and then show that the successful attempt
    was logged.
    10. Start another game and select a different sequence length.
    11. Input the sequence incorrectly.
    12. Return to the start screen and show that the attempt summary 
    has updated.

4.  Hints

    This is a description of the core functionality. Often, problem
    statements from users lack details. As you are prototyping a design,
    you may uncover other behaviours that have not been specified, but
    make sense in the context and intent of the application. For
    example, think about how someone might effectively use your
    application. It is up to you to decide what functions your design
    will need, based on the given problem description and valid
    assumptions, in discussion with your users (the TAs and instructor).
    You should consider asking the customer (the instructor) what they
    want to see. While you may discuss your design with other students,
    the code and documentation must be your own work.

    Code from publicly available sources may be used within reason and
    only if their licenses permit so. Always fully cite to give proper
    credit to the original developers in the source code and in the
    system documentation. For example, in citing a work, at least state:
    from whom, the date of publication, license, and URL. Do what is
    required by its license.

    The TAs will be inspecting your code, so \"major\" commented-out
    experiments should be cleaned up so that the code is readable.

    Do not skimp on the UML class diagrams in the system documentation.
    For neatness and readability, diagrams should be created or drawn
    using a vector graphics editing tool and exported in a common,
    non-lossy graphics format.

    Besides addressing the problem correctly, your software design will
    be evaluated on its proper use of object-oriented design concepts,
    such as separation of concerns and information hiding.

5.  Losing Marks

    You may lose marks for any of the following:

    -   **files not in properly named subdirectories**
    -   missing compiled binary APK file for the app
    -   cannot run the app after install
    -   cannot distinguish CCID from the app name
    -   cannot view files without specialized tools
    -   lossy compression used in image file(s) for UML (e.g., JPEG)
    -   inadequate or improper citations
    -   missing license
    -   using RAR archive format

    These are brown M&M rules.

6.  Submission Procedure:

    -   Zip the **YOURCCID-RapidRecall** directory and upload.
> [!NOTE]
> - If any of the above submission steps are not followed, then the misplaced file(s) will be considered "incomplete" and your grade reduced accordingly.
> - We have included a bash script called `check_filename_a1.sh` that you can use to check the name of your zip file. Put the bash script in the same directory as the zip file, and then run it.
